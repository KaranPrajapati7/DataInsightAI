# DataInsightAI
InsightBot is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to interact with datasets using natural language. By simply uploading a CSV file and asking questions in plain English, users can generate insights, visualizations, and summaries—no coding or SQL required.

This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret questions, analyze data, and return meaningful responses. It's ideal for data analysts, product managers, and non-technical users who want quick, smart answers from their data.
