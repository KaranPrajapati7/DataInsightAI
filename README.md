# DataInsightAI
InsightBot is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to interact with datasets using natural language. By simply uploading a CSV file and asking questions in plain English, users can generate insights, visualizations, and summaries—no coding or SQL required.

This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret questions, analyze data, and return meaningful responses. It's ideal for data analysts, product managers, and non-technical users who want quick, smart answers from their data.

# Features

    1. Natural Language Queries – Ask questions like "What are the top-selling products?" or "Show monthly revenue trends."

    2. Automatic Data Analysis – The app interprets your question and runs the appropriate operations (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.).

    3. Data Visualizations – Generates charts and graphs to illustrate patterns and insights.

    4. LLM-Driven Intelligence – Uses GPT-powered backends for intelligent data interpretation and conversational flow.

    5. CSV File Upload – Simple drag-and-drop interface for uploading datasets.

    6. Fast & Interactive – Instant results without writing a single line of code.
