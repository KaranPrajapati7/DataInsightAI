# DataInsightAI
InsightBot is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to interact with datasets using natural language. By simply uploading a CSV file and asking questions in plain English, users can generate insights, visualizations, and summaries—no coding or SQL required.

This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret questions, analyze data, and return meaningful responses. It's ideal for data analysts, product managers, and non-technical users who want quick, smart answers from their data.

# Features

    1. Natural Language Queries – Ask questions like "What are the top-selling products?" or "Show monthly revenue trends."

    2. Automatic Data Analysis – The app interprets your question and runs the appropriate operations (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.).

    3. Data Visualizations – Generates charts and graphs to illustrate patterns and insights.

    4. LLM-Driven Intelligence – Uses GPT-powered backends for intelligent data interpretation and conversational flow.

    5. CSV File Upload – Simple drag-and-drop interface for uploading datasets.

    6. Fast & Interactive – Instant results without writing a single line of code.

# Tech-Stack

    1. Programming Language

        - Python – Core language for backend logic and data manipulation.

    2. AI & NLP

        - OpenAI GPT-4 – Powers the natural language understanding and insight generation.

        - LangChain – Facilitates prompt engineering, query parsing, and interaction between the LLM and your data.

    3. Data Processing & Visualization

        - Pandas – For reading, cleaning, and transforming CSV data.

        - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Generate dynamic charts and graphs from data queries.

    4. User Interface

        - Streamlit (or Gradio) – Provides an interactive and responsive web interface for uploading data and chatting with the bot.

    5. Deployment

        - Replit – Quick, browser-based deployment for demos.

        - Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces – For hosting public or private instances with minimal setup.

# Installation

    1. Prerequisites

        - Python 3.8 or higher

        - OpenAI API key (or compatible LLM API key)

    2. Setup Steps

        - Clone the repository:

            git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InsightBot.git

        - Navigate into the project folder:

            cd InsightBot

        - Install dependencies:

            pip install -r requirements.txt

        - Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API key:

            OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Upload Data

    1. Open the app interface.

    2. Drag and drop your CSV file or use the file selector.

    3. Once uploaded, the data is ready for queries.

    4. Ask any data-related questions in natural language.

# Screenshots

    1. Main Chat Interface: Where you enter queries and view responses.

    2. File Upload: Simple drag-and-drop or browse for CSV upload.

    3. Visualizations: Charts generated dynamically from your queries.

# How It Works

    1. Upload CSV Data: The user uploads a dataset to the app.

    2. Query Understanding: The app uses GPT-4 (via LangChain) to interpret natural language questions.

    3. Data Processing: Python and Pandas run the relevant data operations based on the query.

    4. Result Presentation: Insights and visualizations are generated and displayed instantly.

# Limitations

    1. Best with well-structured CSV files.

    2. Complex or ambiguous queries may produce less accurate responses.

    3. Currently limited to CSV file uploads; no direct database support yet.

    4. Visualization options are basic and may require expansion for advanced analysis.

# Future Improvements

    1. Add support for SQL databases and Excel files.

    2. Implement chat memory to maintain context across multiple queries.

    3. Enhance visualization capabilities with interactive dashboards.

    4. Enable exporting reports in PDF or other formats.

    5. Incorporate user authentication and multi-user support.
